Context Scripting Suite is desinged to compile and execute scripts
using TCtxScript component, implementing stack processor. Context

Its main features are:

  - Fast script compilation (into intermediate code) & execution. 
  - Virtualized compiler allows to add more languages.
  - Allows script debugging: stopping, resuming, evaluating
    watch expressions, inspection of call stack and more.
  - Fast and one time only name resolution done with 
    virtualized and extensible introspectors, that allow to
    extend and create your own object model.
  - Very small footprint.
  - Easily extensible array of external functions.
  - Easy to create custom object model and publish methods of 
    existing classes.
  - Supports dinamic variant arrays.
  - Supports parameters passed by value and by address (var, out)
  - Allow to compile and evaluate procedures, functions and 
    simple expressions.
  - Supports exception handling with try..except, try..finally, raise
    directives and exception variable.
  - Default compiler supports most of Delphi statements, like
    while...do, repeat...until, for...to, for...downto, if...then[...else],
    goto, exception handling, @<variable> and more.
  - Includes large library of familiar standard routines from SysUtils unit.

The package also includes help files and demos, explaining most of
its functionality.
