
    CONTEXT SCRPIPT TO DO LIST:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Do something about pragmas {$DESCRIPTION }
    - Saving/Loading to/from stream in text format
    - Unit parsing?

    - Separate unops & binops from other instructions
    - Compiler callbacks, overloaded operators
    - Extendable set of directives
    - Introspectors: list of names and name's properties (Field, Prop, Method)

    - Classes, class methods, constructors & varClass
    - Auto process non-virtual methods (push parameters on stack)
    - Auto process virtual methods (locate address in VMT)
    - Auto process dynamic methods (locate address in DMT)
    - Create integrated debugger as a component (separate exe, dll?)

    - 'with' statement (problem with exceptions, need to code try-finally)
    - VCL.Net portability
    - Create TCtxCCompiler & TCtxBasCompiler

    - Multi-threading = Invoking same PCode in different Script Engines
      remember last scripting in PCode, reset Invoke info if Scripting
      is different, remember Invoke info in Scripting, association of
      pre-compiled code with invoke info, so we don't have to resolve
      names every time for small often invoked scripts
